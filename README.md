# sample-socialnetworkanalysis

This is sample code of a class project that focused on creating an ajacency list from a sample list of social media accounts. Using this list, the program outputs the most connected account, and every account two degrees from the root account. This is the original code. If you see this code elsewhere without credit, it was likely stolen.
